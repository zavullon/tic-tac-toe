Alright, so I chose a library, called *python-telegram-bot*, it helps me 
to work with **telegram BOT API**. It was the most starred telegram BOT API 
library among the others, that's why it was my choice. I've also decided
to make this test project an opportunity to finally get to know *HEROKU*.
HEROKU requires a *postgresql* database, so I've decided to take some
time and read into the *psycopg2* library, which is used to interact with
Postgres DB. I've spent 2 days on this project, of course not full days, 
the fact that I'm still a student should be taken into account. Nevertheless,
I've figured out *heroku, postgresql, psycopg2* and pretty much *python-telegram-bot*
with **telegram BOT API**. 

Anyway, this is pretty much the first working release, you can see the commits.
My bot can play tic-tac-toe with user or arrange a game between two users.
I'd say that the project turned out to be expandable, but a bit messy, since
it was made in a hurry. I'm happy to here your thoughts on this, maybe you
want me to change something real quick, let me know.

here's a link to my bot - https://teleg.run/zavToDo_bot
